Diffusion model work by denoising the noise in the image.

*TRAINING PROGRESS*
- First the system will generally add noise to the image on each timesteps(t: int) 
- The model will learn the way to reverse these noise step.

*Sampling(aka: the process to turn text to image)*
- The system will generate a random image with noises
- Model will denoise the noise in the image during each step

*Methodoloy*
- There is 2 things need to consider in text-to-image diffusion model: Text prompts and timesteps
+ text prompts will be turned into the vectorized space(this called EMBEDDING)
+ timesteps (commonly be a simple interger "t"), this also need to be embedded(for timesteps, this called positional embedding).
The reason for this need is, the model need to know the timesteps it will working on.
